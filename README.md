# Hi there, I'm Shade! 👋

💻 on a Frontend Developer journey  |  🎨 UI/UX Designer (10+ years)  

I'm a **brand new coder** diving headfirst into the world of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!** 🎉  
Currently breaking my code more than fixing it, but hey, that's part of the journey, right? 😆  

---

### 💻 What I’ve Learned So Far:
✔ `<h1>` makes **big text** (Wow!)  
✔ CSS can change colors (Fancy 🎨)  
✔ JavaScript is... *a little scary, but exciting!* 👀  

---

### 🎯 My Goals:
🚀 Build a simple website without it looking like it came from 1998  
🎨 Make CSS behave (Why is it so stubborn?!)  
🕹️ Create a **cool JavaScript button** that actually does something  

---

### 📌 Current Struggles:
- Positioning elements in CSS (Why is `margin: auto;` not working?? 😭)  
- Remembering to close my `<div>` tags 🤦  
- Debugging JavaScript (a.k.a **"console.log is my best friend"** 😂)  

---

### 🎉 Fun Facts:
- I type `console.log("Hello, world!");` at least **10 times a day**  
- I once spent **3 hours** fixing a bug... turns out I just forgot a **semicolon** 😅  
- My CSS file is basically:  
  ```css
  body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background: #f0f0f0;
    /* I have no idea what I'm doing */
  }
